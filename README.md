Air Quality Prediction- The aim of this project is to do data analysis on India's Air Quality data and predict the value of the Air Quality Index based on given features of concentration of sulfur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide, respirable suspended particulate matter, suspended particulate matter and classify the Air Quality as good, moderate, poor, unhealthy, healthy. The data is combined(across the years and states) and largely clean version of the Historical Daily Ambient Air Quality Data released by the Ministry of Environment and Forests and Central Pollution Control Board of India under the National Data Sharing and Accessibility Policy (NDSAP) year 1990-2015
After classifying the dataset into 5 categories with the help of Logistic regression, KNN, Decision Tree classification, and Random Forest Classification; It was found that the accuracy and the kappa score were found to be maximum for Random Forest Classification. The Air quality index was found by using the regression algorithms of Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regression, and Random Forest Regression. The value of the mean squared error was found for all of them.
